node server.js
```

## Installation

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) | [Insomia](https://insomnia.rest/download) | [MySQL](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2)

**_Once Installed:_**

1. Clone the Repository on to your machine.
2. Open the terminal and ensure you are in the right file path.
3. Run the command `npm install` to download the packages.
4. Then run the command `node server.js` to run the software.

## User Story

```

SO THAT my company can compete with other e-commerce companies
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a functional Express.js API
WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize
WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database
